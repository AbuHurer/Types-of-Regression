# Regression Examples in Machine Learning

This project demonstrates **10 types of regression techniques** using simple Python examples with `scikit-learn` and `xgboost`.

## üìÇ Files

* `regression_examples.py` ‚Äì Python script containing all regression model implementations.

## üß† Regression Types Covered

1. **Linear Regression** ‚Äì Predicts salary based on years of experience using a straight line fit.
2. **Ridge Regression** ‚Äì Adds L2 regularization to linear regression.
3. **Lasso Regression** ‚Äì Adds L1 regularization, also helpful for feature selection.
4. **Polynomial Regression** ‚Äì Fits non-linear data with polynomial features.
5. **Logistic Regression** ‚Äì A classification model (not true regression), used here to predict pass/fail.
6. **ElasticNet Regression** ‚Äì Combines L1 and L2 penalties for a balanced regularization.
7. **Support Vector Regression (SVR)** ‚Äì Regression using Support Vector Machines.
8. **Decision Tree Regression** ‚Äì Non-linear model using decision trees.
9. **Random Forest Regression** ‚Äì Ensemble of decision trees to improve prediction.
10. **XGBoost Regression** ‚Äì Powerful boosting model optimized for performance.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3 and the required packages installed:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn xgboost
```

2. Run the script:

```bash
python regression_examples.py
```

## üìä Output

Each model will print its prediction for a new data point (e.g., predicting salary for 6 years of experience).

## ‚úÖ Purpose

This script is designed for beginners and intermediate learners to:

* Understand the differences between various regression techniques
* See how to implement them quickly
* Learn which models are useful for linear vs. non-linear data
